From Andrew:

I am re-writing a portion of LogonUI due to some really poor development practices that caused LogonUI to not be great.
LogonUI was the first component I wrote for Servr Co OS, when the code base was only in the kilobytes, and it is just a module included by shell.py, not a standalone app.

My planned changes:
1. Store the password somewhere, so we're not stuck with a hard-coded password.
2. If the password file is missing, use the default password "ServrCoOS"
3. Make the UI design much better.

How will I make sure this code isn't as bad as the original LogonUI?
1. Follow the best practices I've learned recently
2. Comment the code (that's another reason I need to re-write.)
